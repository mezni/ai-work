# Sequence Diagrams

Diagrams of the `support-ops-agent` runtime as it exists at version **0.0.9**.

These describe **implemented** behaviour, not the target architecture in
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md). Where a code path raises `NotImplementedError`, that is shown
explicitly rather than drawn as a working step.

Companion to [class-diagram.md](class-diagram.md), which shows types and relationships.

Rendered automatically by GitHub, GitLab, and any Mermaid-capable Markdown viewer.

## 1. Startup and configuration resolution

Entry point `support_ops.main.main`. Configuration is resolved from the project root,
**not** the current working directory, so `python -m support_ops.main` behaves the same
from any directory.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CLI as __main__
    participant Main as main.main
    participant Settings as Settings
    participant EnvFile as .env at PROJECT_ROOT
    participant Validator as _require_credentials
    participant LLMClient as LLMClient
    participant Seed as knowledge.seed
    participant Store as KnowledgeStore
    participant Retriever as KnowledgeRetriever
    participant Registry as create_default_registry
    participant MemoryMgr as MemoryManager
    participant SDK as openai.OpenAI

    CLI->>Main: runpy invokes main
    Main->>Settings: Settings
    Settings->>EnvFile: read env_file absolute path
    EnvFile-->>Settings: OPENROUTER_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_MODEL
    Settings->>Validator: model_validator mode after
    alt any value empty
        Validator-->>CLI: ValidationError naming missing vars and .env path
    else both present
        Validator-->>Settings: Settings instance
    end
    Settings-->>Main: Settings
    Main->>LLMClient: LLMClient settings
    LLMClient->>SDK: OpenAI api_key and base_url openrouter
    SDK-->>LLMClient: client ready
    LLMClient-->>Main: LLMClient
    Main->>Seed: default_documents
    Seed-->>Main: 4 KnowledgeDocument
    Main->>Store: KnowledgeStore documents
    Main->>Retriever: KnowledgeRetriever store
    Main->>Registry: create_default_registry retriever
    Registry-->>Main: ToolRegistry with create_ticket and search_knowledge_base
    Main->>MemoryMgr: MemoryManager
    MemoryMgr-->>Main: fresh short-term buffer and empty customer map
    Main->>Main: build IncomingTicket T-001
```

Key detail: `PROJECT_ROOT` is computed as `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`, so
`env_file` is absolute. An earlier relative `".env"` silently resolved against the cwd
and produced empty credentials.

`create_default_registry` is a module-level factory, **not** a method on `ToolRegistry`.
When it was nested inside the class body, its `-> ToolRegistry` annotation was evaluated
before the name existed, raising `NameError` at import. It now takes a
`KnowledgeRetriever` because `search_knowledge_base` cannot be constructed without one.

---

## 2. Full agent run (the path `main` takes)

`SupportAgent.run` is `decide` followed by `execute`. This is the complete happy path.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Main as main.main
    participant Agent as SupportAgent
    participant LLMClient as LLMClient
    participant SDK as openai.OpenAI
    participant API as OpenRouter API
    participant Registry as ToolRegistry
    participant Tool as CreateTicketTool

    Main->>Agent: run ticket
    Agent->>MemoryMgr: remember_message role user and ticket description
    MemoryMgr-->>Agent: appended to short-term buffer
    Agent->>MemoryMgr: get_customer ticket.customer_id
    alt customer record absent
        MemoryMgr-->>Agent: CustomerMemory created as a side effect
    else customer record present
        MemoryMgr-->>Agent: existing CustomerMemory
    end
    Agent->>LLMClient: decide ticket, structured prompt and AgentDecision
    LLMClient->>SDK: chat.completions.parse response_format AgentDecision
    SDK->>API: HTTPS request
    API-->>SDK: JSON completion
    SDK-->>LLMClient: parsed AgentDecision
    LLMClient-->>Agent: AgentDecision
    Note over Agent: action chosen by the model,<br/>not by dispatch logic
    alt action equals CREATE_TICKET
        Agent->>Registry: get create_ticket
        Registry-->>Agent: CreateTicketTool
        Agent->>Tool: argument_schema then build CreateTicketInput
        Tool-->>Agent: validated CreateTicketInput
        Agent->>Tool: execute arguments
        Tool-->>Agent: ToolResult success and data
        Agent-->>Main: ToolResult
    else action equals DRAFT_RESPONSE
        Agent-->>Main: placeholder string, not implemented
    else action equals ESCALATE
        Agent-->>Main: placeholder string, not implemented
    else model returns search_knowledge_base
        Agent-->>Main: impossible, ValidationError at decide
    end
    Main->>Main: print result
```

The prompt sent in step 2 must state the JSON shape explicitly. `response_format` alone
does not constrain `poolside/laguna-s-2.1:free`, which otherwise replies with Markdown
prose such as `**Chosen action:** escalate` and causes `ValidationError: Invalid JSON`.
The customer-context sections were added to the prompt without disturbing that contract.

**The `search_knowledge_base` tool is reachable.** `AgentAction` includes
`SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE_BASE`, and `execute_decision` resolves and runs it from the registry.
The model can select knowledge search; results are recorded in `AgentState.tool_calls`
and passed back to the next decision via `build_context`.

---

## 3. Memory-augmented decision

Detail of `SupportAgent.decide`, which both reads and writes memory. This matters
The ticket description is recorded once in `run` (before the loop), so repeated `decide` calls no longer duplicate it.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent as SupportAgent
    participant Manager as MemoryManager
    participant Short as ShortTermMemory
    participant Long as LongTermMemory
    participant LLMClient as LLMClient

    Note over Agent,Manager: In 0.0.9 the write happens once in `run`, not in `decide`; see section 2
    Agent->>Manager: get_customer ticket.customer_id
    Manager->>Long: get customer_id
    alt first time this customer is seen
        Long->>Long: insert empty CustomerMemory
        Note over Long: read has a write side effect
    end
    Long-->>Manager: CustomerMemory
    Manager-->>Agent: CustomerMemory
    Agent->>Agent: interpolate facts preferences previous_tickets into prompt
    Agent->>LLMClient: structured prompt and AgentDecision
    LLMClient-->>Agent: AgentDecision
```

Two consequences of doing the write inside `decide`:

1. **Memory is never bounded.** `ShortTermMemory` has no eviction and no maximum length,
   so the buffer grows with recorded messages. Roadmap Phase 6 specifies "Last 5 exchanges".

The customer memory block is serialized with `model_dump_json()` (so it is valid JSON), but other primitive values may be interpolated directly; so the customer block is valid JSON.

```
Customer facts:
{'plan': 'premium'}

Customer preferences:
{'contact': 'email'}

Previous tickets:
['T-000']
```

A newly seen customer renders as `{}` and `[]`, which is indistinguishable from a known
customer that simply has no recorded facts.

---

## 4. Knowledge retrieval

Reachable today only from tests and from `main`, never through the agent. Scoring is
token-set overlap over `title + category + content`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Tool as SearchKnowledgeBaseTool
    participant Input as SearchKnowledgeBaseInput
    participant Retriever as KnowledgeRetriever
    participant Store as KnowledgeStore
    participant Result as SearchResult

    Tool->>Input: validated query and limit
    Tool->>Retriever: search query and limit
    Retriever->>Store: all
    Store-->>Retriever: list of KnowledgeDocument
    loop for each document
        Retriever->>Retriever: lowercase and split title category content
        Retriever->>Retriever: score equals size of word set intersection
    end
    Retriever->>Retriever: sort by score descending and truncate to limit
    Retriever-->>Tool: list of SearchResult
    Tool->>Tool: flatten to dicts with document_id title content score
    Tool-->>Tool: ToolResult data results
```

`limit` is bounded by pydantic at the call site (`ge=1, le=10`), so an out-of-range
value raises before the search runs. Documents scoring zero are dropped entirely, so an
unmatched query returns an empty list rather than low-scoring noise.

Scoring has no stemming, no IDF, and no normalisation: a repeated term cannot raise the
score because sets deduplicate, and `2.0` means literally "two shared words". Matches the
seed corpus, but a customer phrasing like "can't sign in" will not match the
"Account Locked" document.

---

## 5. Tool dispatch detail

The two-phase tool contract inside `execute`. The agent asks the tool for its input
schema, builds a validated model, then executes. It never touches tool internals.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Agent as SupportAgent
    participant Registry as ToolRegistry
    participant Tool as Tool instance
    participant Input as CreateTicketInput

    Agent->>Registry: get create_ticket
    alt name not registered
        Registry-->>Agent: ValueError Unknown tool
    else name registered
        Registry-->>Agent: Tool
    end
    Agent->>Tool: argument_schema
    Tool-->>Agent: type CreateTicketInput
    Agent->>Input: construct with customer_id subject description
    alt required field missing
        Input-->>Agent: ValidationError
    else valid
        Input-->>Agent: CreateTicketInput
        Agent->>Tool: execute arguments
        Tool-->>Agent: ToolResult success message data
    end
```

`ToolRegistry.get` converts `KeyError` to `ValueError` with `from None`, so callers see
one exception type for both unknown-tool and duplicate-tool. `register` raises
`ValueError` on a duplicate name, which is why `create_default_registry` can only be
called once per registry.

---

## 6. Unimplemented classifier path

`TicketClassifier.classify` sends a prompt and then **discards** the response, raising
`NotImplementedError`. It is not constructed by `main`, so this path is unreachable in
normal operation.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Caller as Unreachable caller
    participant Classifier as TicketClassifier
    participant LLMClient as LLMClient
    participant API as OpenRouter API
    participant Missing as Parsing NOT IMPLEMENTED

    Caller->>Classifier: classify ticket
    Classifier->>LLMClient: chat prompt requesting JSON
    LLMClient->>API: request
    API-->>LLMClient: JSON string
    LLMClient-->>Classifier: str
    Note over Classifier,Missing: result captured then discarded.<br/>Uses llm.chat, not llm.structured.
    Classifier-->>Missing: NotImplementedError
```

The prompt here already contains a correct `Return JSON with exactly these fields`
block, so the fix is a one-line change to call
`self.llm.structured(prompt, TicketClassification)` instead of `self.llm.chat(prompt)`.

---

## 7. Structured output contract

`LLMClient.structured` is generic over pydantic models and is the single place where
model output becomes a typed value.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Caller as Agent or Classifier
    participant LLMClient as LLMClient
    participant SDK as openai.OpenAI
    participant API as OpenRouter API

    Caller->>LLMClient: structured prompt and output_model type T
    LLMClient->>SDK: chat.completions.parse model messages response_format T
    SDK->>API: HTTPS request
    alt model returns valid JSON
        API-->>SDK: content matching schema
        SDK-->>LLMClient: message.parsed instance of T
        LLMClient-->>Caller: T
    else model returns prose or malformed JSON
        API-->>SDK: non JSON content
        SDK-->>LLMClient: ValidationError Invalid JSON
        LLMClient-->>Caller: ValidationError propagates
    else no parsed object
        SDK-->>LLMClient: message.parsed is None
        LLMClient-->>Caller: ValueError Model returned no structured output
    end
```

The middle branch is the one that bit this project: the failure surfaced as a pydantic
`ValidationError` from inside the OpenAI SDK, not as an application-level error, so the
fix belonged in the prompt rather than in the transport.

  their behavioural traps.
- `CHANGELOG.md` for what changed in 0.0.9.
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for the target architecture. The memory layer documented here
  is Phase 2, and it is behind the roadmap in three respects: the store is per-process
  rather than SQLite, `ShortTermMemory` is unbounded rather than "Last 5 exchanges", and
  nothing populates long-term facts or previous tickets automatically.
## 0.0.9 Evaluation Architecture

  Agent Runtime (unchanged)

The persistence layer uses SQLite as the storage backend, with a Repository pattern
that enables swapping database backends without changing the agent.

Component reference updates:
- `persistence/database.py` — `Database` with `connect()` method
- `persistence/models.py` — `SCHEMA` SQL schema + `initialize_database()`
- `persistence/repositories/__init__.py` — `CustomerMemoryRepository`, `TicketRepository`, `TraceRepository`
- `persistence/repositories/customer_memory.py` — `CustomerMemoryRepository` with `save()`/`get()`
- `persistence/repositories/tickets.py` — `TicketRepository` with `add_customer_ticket()`/`get_customer_tickets()`
- `persistence/repositories/traces.py` — `TraceRepository` with `save()`/`get_run()`
- `data/support_ops.db` — created on first run via `initialize_database(Database())`

Evaluation should be separate from production logic:
- Agent runtime lives in `agent/agent.py`
- Persistence layer is standalone, takes a `Database` argument
- Production code should not import from `tests/persistence/`

The persistence architecture complements the evaluation architecture (0.0.9):
- Evaluation provides regression testing
- Persistence provides durability across restarts
- Together they enable production-grade agent development

1. Build agent
2. Run evaluation dataset
3. Measure results
4. Find failures
5. Change prompt/tool/policy
6. Rerun and compare
7. Keep or reject change

The evaluation and persistence architectures are complementary and both
are Phase 12 additions.

Sequence dependency:
Evaluation Dataset → Agent Run → Agent Output → Evaluator → Metrics → Report

The architecture enables engineering-level agent development:
1. Build agent to run evaluation dataset
2. Measure results and find failures
3. Change prompt/tool/policy
4. Rerun and compare
5. Keep or reject change

Component reference updates:
- evaluation/ package: cases.py, metrics.py, runner.py, __init__.py
- tests/evaluation/: 10 tests covering metrics and cases
- EVALUATION_CASES: 4 golden tickets (duplicate_billing, account_locked, security_incident, general_question)
- EvaluationMetrics: total/passed/accuracy property
- calculate_accuracy(expected, actual): fraction of matching items
- EvaluationRunner.run(cases): iterates cases, checks state.status == COMPLETED

Evaluation should be separate from production logic:
- Agent runtime lives in agent/agent.py
- Evaluation runner is standalone, takes an agent argument
- Production code should not import from tests/evaluation/

Phase 10 architecture diagram:
ticket → context + memory → agent state → LLM reasoning → decision → guardrails → tool registry → tools/knowledge, with evaluation runner tapping the agent output branch.
