# Quickstart / Validation Guide: Domain Model Validation

**Feature**: [spec.md](spec.md) | **Rules**: [validation-rules.md](contracts/validation-rules.md) | **Wire contract**: [contracts/http-api.md](contracts/http-api.md) | **Model**: [data-model.md](data-model.md)

This guide validates the Phase 3 gateway without credentials, providers, or any
other external service. Every scenario is a request/response check or a command
run; the phase's rule logic is additionally covered by the automated suite.

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.98.1, installed through `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- `curl` and `python3` for building exact-size request bodies.
- A checkout containing the completed Phase 3 implementation.

## Setup and Quality Gates

From the repository root:

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo check --all-targets
cargo test --all-targets
cargo build
cargo build --release
```

**Expected**: every command succeeds. The test suite includes the existing
endpoint, validation, concurrency, readiness, and shutdown coverage plus the
rule-by-rule, boundary, and precedence checks for this phase.

## Start the Gateway

```bash
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
./target/debug/ai-gateway > /tmp/ai-gateway-domain-validation.log 2>&1 &
GATEWAY_PID=$!
trap 'kill "$GATEWAY_PID" 2>/dev/null || true' EXIT

READY=0
for attempt in $(seq 1 50); do
  if curl --silent --fail "${BASE_URL}/ready" >/dev/null; then
    READY=1
    break
  fi
  sleep 0.1
done
test "$READY" -eq 1
```

**Expected**: the process remains running and reports ready.

Define a helper that prints only the status, code, and message of a response so
each scenario can be compared at a glance:

```bash
post() {
  curl --silent --output /tmp/ai-gateway-body.json \
    --write-out '%{http_code}\n' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data "$1" "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions"
  cat /tmp/ai-gateway-body.json; echo
}
```

## Scenario 1: Canonical Request

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200 and the mock completion envelope from the wire contract,
with no `usage` field.

## Scenario 2: In-Range Generation Controls

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":0.7,"max_tokens":500}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":0.0,"max_tokens":1}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":2.0,"max_tokens":4096}'
```

**Expected**: three HTTP 200 responses whose bodies are identical to Scenario 1.
Accepting a control does not change the mock output, because no model is
connected.

## Scenario 3: Controls Omitted

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200, byte-identical to Scenario 2. The gateway does not invent
a control value and does not report one as client-supplied.

## Scenario 4: Out-of-Range Controls

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":2.0001}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":-0.1}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":4097}'
post '{"model":"mock-template","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":0}'
```

**Expected**: four HTTP 400 responses, each exactly:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid_request",
  "message": "The chat request is invalid."
}
```

The `0.0`/`2.0` and `1`/`4096` boundaries were accepted in Scenario 2; these
are the first values outside them.

## Scenario 5: Non-Numeric Controls

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":"0.5"}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":true}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":null}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":[500]}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":100.5}'
```

**Expected**: five HTTP 400 `invalid_request` responses and no 500. A `null`
control is a refusal, not an omission; `100.5` is refused because a token count
is an integer.

## Scenario 6: Repeated Control

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":0.5,"temperature":1.0}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"max_tokens":10,"max_tokens":20}'
```

**Expected**: two HTTP 400 `invalid_request` responses. Neither occurrence is
silently selected.

## Scenario 7: Required Fields, Roles, and Content

```bash
post '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[]}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"tool","content":"Hello"}]}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":""}]}'
post '{"model":"","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

**Expected**: five HTTP 400 `invalid_request` responses with the fixed message
and no echo of the submitted model, role, or content.

## Scenario 8: No Diagnostic Leakage

Submit a rejected request whose values are unique markers, then confirm none of
them appear in the response:

```bash
body='{"model":"LEAK_MODEL_MARKER","messages":[{"role":"LEAK_ROLE_MARKER","content":"LEAK_PROMPT_MARKER"}]}'
curl --silent --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data "$body" \
  "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions" > /tmp/ai-gateway-leak.json
for marker in LEAK_MODEL_MARKER LEAK_ROLE_MARKER LEAK_PROMPT_MARKER missing field invalid type serde; do
  if grep --quiet --fixed-strings "$marker" /tmp/ai-gateway-leak.json; then
    echo "LEAKED: $marker"; exit 1
  fi
done
cat /tmp/ai-gateway-leak.json
```

**Expected**: no `LEAKED` line; the body is exactly the two-field
`invalid_request` object.

## Scenario 9: Request Size Boundary

`SIZE_LIMIT` is 1 048 576 bytes. Build a valid request padded with a long
content string to hit each size exactly:

```bash
build_body() {
  python3 - "$1" <<'PY'
import json, sys
target = int(sys.argv[1])
base = {"model": "mock-model", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}]}
pad = target - len(json.dumps(base, separators=(",", ":")))
base["messages"][0]["content"] = "x" * max(pad, 0)
body = json.dumps(base, separators=(",", ":"))
assert len(body) == target, (len(body), target)
print(body)
PY
}

AT_LIMIT=$(build_body 1048576)
OVER_LIMIT=$(build_body 1048577)
printf '%s' "${AT_LIMIT}" | wc -c
printf '%s' "${OVER_LIMIT}" | wc -c

curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out 'at limit:   %{http_code}\n' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary "${AT_LIMIT}" \
  "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions"
curl --silent --write-out 'over limit: %{http_code}\n' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary "${OVER_LIMIT}" \
  "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions"
```

**Expected**: the two byte counts are `1048576` and `1048577`; the responses are
`at limit: 200` and `over limit: 413`, the latter with exactly:

```json
{
  "code": "payload_too_large",
  "message": "The request payload is too large."
}
```

Then confirm the gateway is unharmed:

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out 'health: %{http_code}\n' "${BASE_URL}/health"
curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out 'ready:  %{http_code}\n' "${BASE_URL}/ready"
```

**Expected**: the canonical request returns 200 and the probes return 200.

## Scenario 10: Precedence

Oversize wins over media type, because an oversized body cannot be validated
without reading it:

```bash
curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out 'oversize + text/plain: %{http_code}\n' \
  --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' --data-binary "${OVER_LIMIT}" \
  "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions"
```

**Expected**: `413`, not `415`.

Invalidity wins over streaming:

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
post '{"model":"","messages":[],"stream":true}'
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":9.0,"stream":true}'
```

**Expected**: `400 unsupported_feature` for the first and
`400 invalid_request` for the second and third.

## Scenario 11: Streaming, Media Type, Method, and Path

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
curl --silent --write-out '\n' --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
  --data '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[]}' "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions"
curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out 'POST /health: %{http_code}\n' --request POST "${BASE_URL}/health"
curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '/not-a-route: %{http_code}\n' "${BASE_URL}/not-a-route"
```

**Expected**: `400 unsupported_feature`; `415 unsupported_media_type`;
`405 method_not_allowed`; `404 not_found`. These rows are unchanged from Phase 2.

## Scenario 12: Unknown Fields Are Ignored

```bash
post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello","name":"ignored"}],"top_p":0.1,"future_option":{"a":1}}'
```

**Expected**: HTTP 200 with the mock completion.

## Scenario 13: Determinism and Concurrency

```bash
for request in $(seq 1 100); do
  post '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}' >> /tmp/ai-gateway-repeat.txt
done
sort --unique /tmp/ai-gateway-repeat.txt | wc -l
```

**Expected**: `1` — every repetition returns the same status and the same body.

```bash
for request in $(seq 1 50); do
  curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}\n' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"model":"mock-model","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"temperature":1.5,"max_tokens":100}' \
    "${BASE_URL}/v1/chat/completions" &
done
wait
```

**Expected**: 50 lines of `200`, with no cross-request interference. Automated
tests additionally mix valid and invalid requests concurrently.

## Scenario 14: Offline Operation

Run the scenarios with no provider environment variable, credential, database,
cache, or other service configured, and with no network access beyond loopback.

**Expected**: every scenario behaves exactly as above. Validation contacts no
external service.

## Scenario 15: Clean Shutdown

```bash
kill -TERM "$GATEWAY_PID"
wait "$GATEWAY_PID"
GATEWAY_PID=
```

**Expected**: the process exits successfully within 10 seconds and releases the
socket.

## Cleanup

If a scenario failed before normal shutdown:

```bash
kill -TERM "$GATEWAY_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
wait "$GATEWAY_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Verification Record

All 15 scenarios were executed against a running debug build
(`./target/debug/ai-gateway`) on 2026-09-30, with `AI_GATEWAY_HOST` and
`AI_GATEWAY_PORT` unset so no external configuration was present.

| # | Scenario | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Canonical request — 200, mock envelope, no `usage` field | as expected |
| 2 | In-range controls — 3x 200, all bodies byte-identical to Scenario 1 | as expected |
| 3 | Controls omitted — 200, byte-identical to Scenario 1 and 2 | as expected |
| 4 | Out-of-range controls — 4x `400 invalid_request` | as expected |
| 5 | Non-numeric controls — 5x `400 invalid_request`, no 500 | as expected |
| 6 | Repeated control — 2x `400 invalid_request` | as expected |
| 7 | Required fields, roles, content — 5x `400 invalid_request` | as expected |
| 8 | No diagnostic leakage — no marker in the body, exact two-field object | as expected |
| 9 | Size boundary — 1048576 bytes -> 200, 1048577 -> 413 `payload_too_large`; health, readiness, and the next canonical request all 200 | as expected |
| 10 | Precedence — oversize + `text/plain` -> 413; stream only -> `unsupported_feature`; invalid + stream and control-range + stream -> `invalid_request` | as expected |
| 11 | Media type 415, `POST /health` 405, unknown path 404 | as expected |
| 12 | Unknown fields ignored — 200 | as expected |
| 13 | Determinism — 100 repetitions produced 1 unique response; 50 concurrent requests all 200 | as expected |
| 14 | Offline operation — no provider, credential, database, or cache variable present | as expected |
| 15 | Clean shutdown — exit 0 within 10 seconds, port refuses connections afterwards | as expected |

49 of 49 recorded assertions matched. Three defects surfaced during this run,
all in the verification harness rather than the gateway, and each is worth
recording because the same mistake is easy to repeat:

- Passing a 1 MiB body as a `curl` argument exceeds `ARG_MAX`; the size
  scenario must use `--data-binary @file`.
- A helper that builds an exact-size body must write the bytes without a
  trailing newline, or every body is one byte over the limit and Scenario 9
  fails for the wrong reason.
- `curl` exiting with status 7 (connection refused) is the *expected* result
  after shutdown, so the assertion must expect 7, not 0.
