## [0.1.12] — Reliability

- Added `ToolExecutionResult` model in `src/support_agent/models/tool_result.py` — structured success/failure data for all tool calls.
- Rewrote `src/support_agent/tools/dispatcher.py` to return `ToolExecutionResult` instead of raising exceptions, providing an error boundary between tools and the agent loop.
- Added `src/support_agent/reliability.py` with `retry()` helper for read-only operation retries.
- Added `docs/experiments/08_reliability.md` documenting reliability experiment goals, failure cases, and observations.
- Updated `src/support_agent/agent.py` to use `result.model_dump_json()` for structured tool results, and added `max_tool_calls = 10` budget tracking.
- Added reliability rules in the system prompt: check tool results before claiming success, distinguish read-only vs state-changing tool retry policies, do not repeatedly call failed tools without reason.
- Updated `tests/test_tool_dispatcher.py` with `test_tool_failure_is_returned_as_result` and adjusted existing tests for the new `ToolExecutionResult` return type.

## [0.1.14] — Historical Ticket Search

- Added `data/historical_tickets.json` with 5 sample tickets across technical_support, billing, account, and security categories.
- Added `src/support_agent/models/research.py` `HistoricalTicket` and `SimilarTicket` Pydantic models.
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/historical_tickets.py` `search_similar_tickets()` — keyword-matching search against historical ticket store.
- Added `tests/test_historical_tickets.py` with `test_search_similar_tickets()` asserting results return the correct category.
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/schemas.py` `SEARCH_SIMILAR_TICKETS_TOOL` schema.
- Updated `src/support_agent/tools/registry.py` to register `search_similar_tickets` in `TOOL_FUNCTIONS` and `TOOL_SCHEMAS`.
- Added `src/support_agent/research_agent.py` `run_research_agent()` — research agent loop that uses `search_similar_tickets` tool and returns concise findings without making decisions about refunds, account changes, or escalation.

## [0.1.15] — Multi-Agent Handoff

- Added `src/support_agent/models/handoff.py` `ResearchRequest`, `ResearchResult`, and `SimilarTicket` Pydantic models for explicit handoff contracts.
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/agent_tools.py` `RESEARCH_AGENT_TOOLS` and `SUPPORT_AGENT_TOOLS` — agent-specific tool sets to prevent redundant tool calls.
- Added `src/support_agent/orchestrator.py` `build_research_request()` and `research_ticket()` — orchestrates the workflow between research and support agents.
- Added `src/support_agent/agent.py` `research` parameter; research findings injected as context into the support agent loop.
- Added `tests/test_handoff.py` — 3 tests verifying research request context, exclusive tool sets for research and support agents.
- Added `docs/experiments/11_multi_agent_handoff.md` documenting the multi-agent handoff experiment, agent responsibilities, handoff contract, and lessons learned.

## [0.1.13] — Conversation Memory

- Added `src/support_agent/memory/conversation.py` `ConversationMemory` dataclass for persistent conversation state.
- Updated `src/support_agent/agent.py` to accept optional `memory` parameter; memory is the source of truth for `chat_with_tools()`.
- Added `add_user_message()`, `add_assistant_message()`, `add_message()`, `get_messages()`, and `clear()` methods.
- User-provided memory enables shared context across multiple `run_agent()` calls; a fresh `ConversationMemory()` starts a new conversation.
- Conversation history is preserved in `memory.messages` and retrieved via `memory.get_messages()` each iteration.
- Added `docs/experiments/09_memory.md` documenting memory experiment goals, implementation, and limitations.

| Version | Feature Domain | Key Objectives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1.13 | Conversation Memory | Inject `ConversationMemory` into `run_agent()`; message history persists across calls; caller owns memory lifetime for shared or fresh contexts. |
| 0.1.11 | Escalate-to-Human Action Tool | Record human-intervention escalations via a validated `escalate_to_human` tool; advertise all three tools in the agent prompt. |
| 0.1.10 | Create-Ticket Action Tool | Record follow-up tickets via a validated `create_ticket` tool writing to a JSON store. |
| 0.1.9 | Tool Registry & Agent Loop Cleanup | Centralize schemas + functions in a registry; fix the loop to run all tool calls before answering. |
| 0.1.8 | Agent with Triage Context | Feed extraction + triage into the agent; make triage an explicit constraint. |
| 0.1.7 | Agent Loop | Run the `tool_use`/`tool_result` loop over the KB search tool with a maximum-iteration guard. |
| 0.1.6 | Tool Schema Engineering | Replace a deliberately bad tool schema with a designed `knowledge_base_search` schema; add a tool dispatcher. |
| 0.1.5 | Knowledge-Base Tool | Ground answers by keyword-searching a fake knowledge base with a registered tool. |
| 0.1.4 | Triage Decision | Classify category/urgency plus knowledge-search and escalation flags from the extracted ticket. |
| 0.1.3 | Structured Extraction | Extract `customer_id`, `product`, `sentiment`, and `priority` from free-form tickets into Pydantic models. |
| 0.1.2 | First LLM Application | Wrap the Anthropic Messages API and parse model JSON output. |
| 0.1.1 | Foundation | Set up the `uv` project, package layout, sample data, and experiment docs. |

## [0.1.11] — Escalate-to-Human Action Tool

- Added `EscalateToHumanInput` and `EscalateToHumanResult` models in `src/support_agent/models/escalation.py` (priority enum-constrained, status `escalated`).
- Added `data/escalations.json` escalation store (initially `[]`).
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/escalation.py` `escalate_to_human()` — validates input via Pydantic, appends to the JSON store, assigns sequential `E###` escalation IDs, and persists.
- Added `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN_TOOL` schema in `src/support_agent/tools/schemas.py` with `ticket_id`, `reason`, `priority` (enum) and `additionalProperties: false`.
- Registered `escalate_to_human` in `src/support_agent/tools/registry.py` — registry now exposes all three tools.
- Added `tests/test_escalation.py`, `test_dispatch_escalate_to_human`, and `test_escalate_to_human_tool_registered` (9 tests passing).
- Reworked the agent system prompt to advertise all three tools with usage rules (no duplicate tickets, use existing customer ID, concise escalation reason, never claim an action unless the tool returned a result).
- Updated `run_agent.py` to pass `Subject:` + `Message:` (including the ticket subject) to the agent instead of the body alone.

## [0.1.10] — Create-Ticket Action Tool

- Added `CreateTicketInput` and `CreateTicketResult` models in `src/support_agent/models/tools.py` (priority enum-constrained, status `created`).
- Added `data/created_tickets.json` JSON ticket store (initially `[]`).
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/ticketing.py` `create_ticket()` — validates input via Pydantic, appends to the JSON store, assigns sequential `CT###` IDs, and persists.
- Added `CREATE_TICKET_TOOL` schema in `src/support_agent/tools/schemas.py` with `customer_id`, `subject`, `description`, `priority` (enum) and `additionalProperties: false`.
- Registered `create_ticket` in `src/support_agent/tools/registry.py` (`TOOL_FUNCTIONS` + `TOOL_SCHEMAS`).
- Added `test_dispatch_create_ticket` (isolated via `tmp_path`/`monkeypatch`) and `test_create_ticket_tool_registered` (6 tests passing).

## [0.1.9] — Tool Registry & Agent Loop Cleanup

- Consolidated `src/support_agent/tools/registry.py` into `TOOL_FUNCTIONS` (name → implementation) and `TOOL_SCHEMAS` (list of tool schemas); the registry now owns both sides of the tool contract.
- Updated `src/support_agent/tools/dispatcher.py` to resolve tools from `TOOL_FUNCTIONS`.
- Refactored `src/support_agent/agent.py` to import only `TOOL_SCHEMAS` (no direct tool imports), collect all `tool_use` blocks per turn, execute every requested tool, and return the joined text only when no tool calls remain — fixing the bug where the agent dropped its KB search and answered with just the preamble.
- Added `test_unknown_tool_raises_error` to `tests/test_tool_dispatcher.py` asserting `ValueError` for unregistered tools; updated `tests/test_knowledge_base.py` to the renamed `TOOL_FUNCTIONS` (4 tests passing).

## [0.1.8] — Agent with Triage Context

- Extended `run_agent()` to accept `extraction: TicketExtraction` and `triage: TriageDecision`, embedding the ticket plus structured extraction and triage decision in the user message.
- Updated the system prompt with triage constraints: no KB search when `needs_knowledge_search` is false (unless required for safety), no returning the case as resolved when `needs_escalation` is true, no inventing policies/refunds/account changes.
- Replaced the standalone `run_agent.py` experiment with the full pipeline runner: `load_tickets` → `extract_ticket` → `decide_triage` → `run_agent` across all tickets.
- Added experiment documentation `docs/experiments/05_agent_with_triage.md`, recording that the agent drops the KB tool call when the loop returns on the first text block (open fix: defer text until tool calls in the turn are resolved).

## [0.1.7] — Agent Loop

- Added `src/support_agent/agent.py` `run_agent()` implementing the `tool_use`/`tool_result` loop over `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SEARCH_TOOL`, dispatching calls through `dispatch_tool()` and feeding results back to the model.
- Bounded the loop with `max_iterations` (default 5), raising `RuntimeError` if the agent exceeds the cap.
- Added `src/support_agent/run_agent.py` CLI runner demonstrating a live internet-troubleshooting ticket.

## [0.1.6] — Tool Schema Engineering

- Removed the deliberately bad schema (`name: search`, generic `input` parameter, "Search stuff." description) from `src/support_agent/tools/schemas.py`.
- Added `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SEARCH_TOOL` in `src/support_agent/tools/schemas.py` with a descriptive name, a purpose-explaining description, and a required `query` parameter with `additionalProperties: false`.
- Updated `src/support_agent/tool_experiment.py` to use `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_SEARCH_TOOL`; live run confirmed the model now requests a meaningful query (`internet down troubleshooting router restart`).
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/dispatcher.py` `dispatch_tool()` — resolves a tool name from `TOOLS` and raises `ValueError` for unknown tools.
- Added `tests/test_tool_dispatcher.py` verifying dispatch of the knowledge-base search.
- Added experiment documentation `docs/experiments/03_structured_extraction.md` and `docs/experiments/04_bad_tool_schema.md`.

## [0.1.5] — Knowledge-Base Tool

- Added `src/support_agent/tools/knowledge_base.py` `knowledge_base_search(query)` — keyword-scoring search returning the top three articles from `data/knowledge_base.json`.
- Added `src/support_agent/tools/registry.py` mapping `knowledge_base_search` to the implementation.
- Added offline tests in `tests/test_knowledge_base.py`.

## [0.1.4] — Triage Decision

- Added `decide_triage()` in `src/support_agent/triage.py` running extraction → LLM → `TriageDecision`.
- Added `src/support_agent/main.py` CLI runner chaining extraction and triage across all tickets.
- Added `src/support_agent/tool_experiment.py` experiment runner for single tool-call behavior.

## [0.1.3] — Structured Extraction

- Added `SupportTicket`, `TicketExtraction`, `TriageResult`, and `TriageDecision` models in `src/support_agent/models/ticket.py`, with enum-constrained `product`, `sentiment`, `priority`, `category`, and `urgency`.
- Added extraction and triage system prompts in `src/support_agent/prompts.py`.
- Added `src/support_agent/extraction.py` `extract_ticket()` running prompt → LLM → JSON → Pydantic validation.
- Added experiment documentation `docs/experiments/01_baseline.md` and `docs/experiments/02_ticket_baseline.md`.

## [0.1.2] — First LLM Application

- Added `src/support_agent/client.py` with `chat()` and `chat_with_tools()` wrappers around the Anthropic Messages API (model `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).
- Added `src/support_agent/json_utils.py` for robust JSON parsing of model output.

## [0.1.16] — Evaluation

- Added `src/support_agent/models/evaluation.py` `EvaluationCase`, `EvaluationResult`, and `EvaluationSummary` Pydantic models for structured evaluation.
- Added `data/evaluation_cases.json` with 5 evaluation cases covering extraction and triage checks.
- Added `src/support_agent/evaluation.py` with `load_evaluation_cases()`, `evaluate_extraction()`, `evaluate_triage()`, and `evaluate_case()` functions.
- Added `scripts/run_evaluation.py` evaluation runner script that compares actual extraction/triage results against expected evaluation cases and reports pass/fail checks and overall pass rate.

## [0.1.1] — Foundation

- Initialized `uv` project (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, virtualenv) with a `src` layout.
- Added runtime dependencies: `anthropic`, `pydantic`, `python-dotenv`.
- Added development dependency: `pytest`.
- Added `.env.example` and gitignored local `.env`.
- Scaffolded package layout under `src/support_agent/` and `tests/`.
- Added sample datasets `data/knowledge_base.json` and `data/tickets/tickets.json`.
